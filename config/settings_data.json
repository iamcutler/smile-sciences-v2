(Do not overload trays; a little goes a long way.)<br /><br />Put gentle pressure on the upper mouth tray by pushing on your upper lip with your fingers in order to ensure a tight fit. Do the same on the lower mouth tray.<br /><br />Wear trays for approximately 20-30 minutes.<br /><br />For faster results place the LED light in front of your trays to activate gel.<br /><br />Once the time is completed, remove mouth trays and rinse out your mouth.<br /><br />Rinse trays in lukewarm water and store in a clean dry place.<br /><br />Repeat daily until desired shade is achieved."
